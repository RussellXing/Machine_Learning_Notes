# Introduction

1. Classic and adaptive machines
	* Classic system: *input values, process and produce outputs results*
	* Adaptive system: *continuous abilit to adapt behavior to external signals*
		* Transformed our electronic tools into actual cognitive extensions
		* Achieved this goal by filling the gap between human perception, language, reasoning, and model and artificial instruments.

2. Descriptive analysis
	* The goal of **descriptive analysis** is to find out an accurate description of the phenomena that are observed and validate all the hypothesis.
	* A **diagnostic model** must be able to connect all the effecs with causes.
	
3. Predictive analysis
	* The goal of a **predictive model** is to minimize the error between actual and 	predictive value.
	* The prediction must be turned into a suggested prescription.
   
4. Supervised learning
	* A **supervised scenario** is characterized by the concept of a teacher or supervisor, whose main task is to provide the agent with a precise measure of its error (directly comparable with output values).
	* **Overfitting** causes overlearning due to an excessive capacity.
	* **Regeression**: based on continuous output values
	* **Classification**: only a dicrete number of possible outcomes
	* Common supervised learning applications:
		* Predictive analysis based on regression or categorical classification
		* Spam detection
		* Pattern detection
		* NLP Sentiment analysis 
		* Automatic image classification 
		* Automatic sequence processing

5. Unsupervised learning
	* To learn how a set of elements can be grouped (clustered)
		* In a recommendation engine, a group of users can be clustered according to the prederence expressed for some books.
	* Common unsupervised applications:
		* Object segmentation
		* Similarity detection
		* Automation labeling
		* Recommendation engines
		
6. Semi-supervised learning
